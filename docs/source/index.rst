Welcome to the **Genome-Centric Metagenomics Workshop**!  

This workshop will teach you how to obtain provisional whole genomes of individual populations from a mixed microbial community using metagenomics. The workshop is divided into **three parts**:

Part I
------
Participants will learn to install required software, check raw sequence read quality, perform read quality control, and trim their sequence data. You will also learn how to upload and download sequence files from online archive databases.

Part II
-------
In this part, you will learn how to assemble and annotate contigs and bin contigs into provisional whole genome sequences.

Part III
--------
Participants will learn how to extract taxonomic information, functional annotations, and pathway information for each binned genome.

Workshop Topic Highlights
------------------------
- Metagenome reads quality check and quality control  
- Assemble quality controlled reads into contigs  
- Annotate assembled contigs  
- Map quality controlled reads onto contigs  
- Bin contigs into provisional genome bins  
- Extract taxonomic, functional, and pathway annotations for each binned genome
